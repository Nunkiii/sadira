sadira
=====

This is an experimental project.

Sadira is a Node.js - browser JavaScript framework aimed at building complex interactive web applications. 

##Communication system

The core of Sadira is its binary communication protocol permitting the exchange of arbitrarilly complex messages between either Node.js servers and web browsers using WebSockets or the newer WebRTC datachanels, allowing browsers and node.js servers to communicate with each other. Using webRTC, sadira can be used as the core of peer to peer applications running between web browsers (and optionally also node.js servers). 

The actual support of webRTC and particulary the datachannel part is still very limited right in curent web browsers, but this technology will surely be broadly available in a near future.
